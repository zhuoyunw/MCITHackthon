**General Idea**  - A general description of what your software will do  
We are building a reminder website for users with functionalities including Upenn academic calendar and a To-Do list. Certain big-event date will be imported from official website (https://almanac.upenn.edu/penn-academic-calendar) and labeled on the calendar like First day of Classes, holidays etc. Users could also add their syllabus to the calendar. All of above will show up in everyday To-Do list. Users will easily add or delete items in their To-Do list to maintain a good habit. This website will make students' life in UPenn easier.  We expect to implement the website through Web designs (JavaScript, HTML, and CSS) and the interactions between front-end and back-end techniques (java, MySQL). 
**Anticipated Stack** - What technologies do you anticipate using?  
HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Java, MySQL
**Presentation URL** - At the end of the hackathon, upload your presentation to YouTube/Vimeo (unlisted) and place it here.
